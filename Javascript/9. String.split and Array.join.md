# String.split

Something that frequently happens in web development is manipulation of date converting between different data types in particular moving between strings and arrays. So you may take something that somebody is typed and you want to split it up into individual words or get the individual characters so that you can do some testing on that data or conversion of that data.

LETS TAKE TWO METHOD
ARRAY.JOIN()
STRING.SPLIT()

//String split and Array join methods
// Converting string to Arrays and Arrays to Strings

// String to ARray str.split()
// Array to STring arr.join()

```javascript
let sentence = "Hello my name is Inigo Montoya";

let words = sentence.split(" "); //split it wherever i find space

console.log(words); //(6)Â ["Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Inigo", "Montoya"]

// Words is array in means that we can use array methods on it such as sort

let words = sentence.split(" ").sort(); // doesn't work because it's using the unicode values for these becuase these are in capital they come before lower case

let chars = sentence.split(" name");
console.log(chars);
(2)[("Hello my ", " is Inigo Montoya")];

//split every single character between each character there is nothing
let chars = setence.split("");
(30)[
  ("H",
  "e",
  "l",
  "l",
  "o",
  " ",
  "m",
  "y",
  " ",
  "n",
  "a",
  "m",
  "e",
  " ",
  "i",
  "s",
  " ",
  "I",
  "n",
  "i",
  "g",
  "o",
  " ",
  "M",
  "o",
  "n",
  "t",
  "o",
  "y",
  "a")
];
```

# array join

```
let hyphenated = words.join("");
console.log(hyphenated); // "HelloInigoMontoyaismyname"

let hyphenated = words.join("-"); //"Hello-Inigo-Montoya-is-my-name"

//
let sentence = "Hello my name is Inigo Montoya";

let x = sentence.split(" ").sort().join(" ");
sentence.split(" ").sort().join(" ");
"Hello Inigo Montoya is my name"
```
