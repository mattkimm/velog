object. That object is being trreated inside of this function as the keyword this. and I'm getting town property from that object and I'm comparing it to the item from the array.

IMPORTANT !

- i did use the old classic javascript function
  if i were to use an arrow function, i get undefined . undefined is the result when a match is not found but ho wcould a match not be found that is because of the way that arrow functions treat the keyword this. They use the value of the keyword `this` here where the function is declared at the time where the function is declared in the place where the function is declared it's a lexical this . At this moment of time before this function(#2) runs , what would the value of this be? well it's going to be the global object if it's in the the browser it's going to be the window object in node it's goting to be in the global object , The global object does not have a property called town so I'm never gonna find a match because this is undefined,
  In order for this to work I have to use the standard function.

If you are going to use `this` argument for any of the methods wiht arrays find , findIndex, map, forEach, filter, reduce they allow you to put in this , this argument as the additional one and if you do that you have to make sure you have to use the standard function

```javascript
let cities = ["Ankara","Istanbul", "Antalya", "Bursa","Trabzon"];
let person = {
	id : 123,
    name : 'Recap',
 	town : 'Istanbul',
}
let match3 = cities.find(function(item){
	if(item === this.town) return true;
}, person);
console.log(person.name, "lives in matching town", match3);


let match4 = cities.find((item) => {
	if(item === this.town) return true;
}, person);
gets undefined

#2 (item) => {
	if(item === this.town) return true;
}
```
