# forEach

it will call a function one time for each element i9n the array. this dwarves.forEach is going to call the output function once for each element in the array and there are three pices of information threee parameters that the for each method is going to pass in .

foEach method look to the array for each time it's going to call this function it'll pass in the item the actualy string, it'll pass index (0~11), passes in the entire array. if you wanted to manipulate it somehow

So this behavior could be replicated with a for loop with a for in loop with while loop but it's a built in method now for the arfray object. it jsut simplfies for us.

```javascript
let dwarves = ['Bifur','Bofur','Bombur','Fili', 'Killi','Oin','Gloin','Thorin','Balin','Dwalin','Nori','Dori'];

dwarves.forEach(output);
function output(item,index,array){
  console.log(index, item); // 0 'Bifur'
}
//put anonymous function write inside
dwarves.forEach((function(item,index,array){
	if(item === 'Thorin'){
      item = item.toUpperCase();
    }else{
      item = item.toLowerCase();

    }
})


//conver all the names to lowercase execept Thorin
// and console.log them
// anonymous function


```
