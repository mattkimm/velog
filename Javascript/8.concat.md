Array.concat();

- short for concatenation is a way that we can quickly combine multiple arrays.

-one way is to loop through an array

```javascript

let a = [2,4,6,8];
let b = [1,3,5];
//loop through another array and then one at a time  you can use push method to add something on to or unshift()
// we have variety of thigns that we can do here for slowly one at a time adding things into an array


for()
for( in)
a.forEach

    // two different ways of writing it.
    // break apart the array and insert the elements one at a time without me having to write a for loop, for each loop or some kind of loop that i have to do one at a time.
let c = a.concat(b);
console.log(c); // [2,4,6,8,1,3,5]

let d = [].concat(a,b);
console.log(d); //[2,4,6,8,1,3,5]

// can chanin together
let e = [].concat(a,b).sort();
```
