for loop we used when we could count the number of items that we wanted to go through so with an array for example we could say hey whats the length of the array. I want to loop five times.

When dealing with objects,because it's an object there is no length property. I can't use for loops because I don't knwo how many items are in there. It doesn't have length property.

How do we loop through everything in that object wihtout knowing how many things are in the object

```javascript

var monsters = { 'Cananda' : 'Sasquatch', 'Nepal':'Yeti', 'Scotland':'Loch Ness'};

console.log(monsters.length); //undefined

// variable in object
for(let prop in monsters){
	console.log(prop); // Canda, Nepal, Scotland
  // I can't do dot notation because this is a variable it'
  //this is a variable that's hoding those three values
    console.log(monsters[prop]);
}

// when your looking at an object instead of an array
when you don't know how many items because there is no lenght property we use a for in loop. we still declare a variable we initialize a variable to use as our counter through the loop we just don't know how many items there are.

We can use for in loop for an array as well

var pets = ["Woody","Roxy", "Bob"];
for(let prop in pets){
  // prop just becomes index
	console.log(prop, pets[prop]);
}
```
